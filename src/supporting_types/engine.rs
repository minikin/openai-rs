///  The other engines have cost advantages.
///  For example, Curie can perform many of the same tasks as Davinci,
///  but faster and for 1/10th the cost.
///  We encourage developers to experiment with using the other models
///  and try to find the one that’s the most efficient for your application.

    // Davinci is going to produce the best results.
    // The trade-off with Davinci is that it costs more to use per API call
    // and other engines are faster.
    //
    // Another area where Davinci shines is in understanding the intent of text.
    // Davinci is quite good at solving many kinds of logic problems
    // and explaining the motives of characters.
    // Davinci has been able to solve some of the most challenging AI problems
    // involving cause and effect.
